Google has updated their Google Images search engine. I quite like the change as it gets rid of pages and presents the image results like its one page. This means no more clicking back and forward, easily comparing images in the search with another image in the search.

I have read some posts on a forum about the update and people seem to be complaining about the cluttered look. I quite like the look as it allows more images to be placed into one frame rather than having a tabulated, space consuming look.
