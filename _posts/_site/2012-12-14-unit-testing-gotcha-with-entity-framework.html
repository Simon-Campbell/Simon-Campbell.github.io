<p>I have been working with the <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdata%2Fef.aspx&amp;ei=8CnMUP7nMa2jiAeC-oHYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnRYM3tghOlk7YE3qY8RyjXpulaQ&amp;sig2=KnR4_5pyp6HCgG6AyjsqNg&amp;bvm=bv.1355325884,d.aGc">Entity Framework</a> at work. It has been used to connect with a database for a RESTful <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.Net Web API</a> service.</p>

<p>Testing the Web API has been interesting to learn about. Originally I decided to test this Web API using <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler</a> to do HTTP POSTs to selected URLs and then analyzing the results. It soon became apparent that this method was slow and error prone– making me opt for unit-testing.</p>

<p>I spent a good portion of the day writing the tests, fixing bugs as I found them. Fortunately, the API scope of the API was relatively small and writing most of the tests did not take too long. That is, until I encountered a weird side effect of the C# Entity Framework.</p>

<p>One of the API method tests that made a POST required the use of a database ObjectContextobject to check if the request actually updated the database entities that it should have. The test however was failing, I believe this was due a ObjectContext being created in the unit-test method and another being created in the method being tested. The two differentObjectContexts were out of sync even though they were attached to the same datastore.</p>

<p>The structure of the code that caused the problem was similar to this piece of skeleton code:</p>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It appears that the Entity Framework tries to be “smart” and efficient which means that the update is not synchronized between the ObjectContexts. In order to work around this I was required to call the Refresh() method on the ObjectContext after the call to Post(), like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-csharp" data-lang="csharp"><span class="n">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Refresh</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">RefreshMode</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">StoreWins</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Entities</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I am not sure if this is the recommended way to work around this but it works and the test will pass as you expect. I will look into this more when I get back to the code at work. I will post any new findings or corrections.</p>
