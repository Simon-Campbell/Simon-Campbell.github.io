<p>If you go to <a href="http://bodybrowser.googlelabs.com/">Google Body</a> in Firefox 4, do you get an error stating that WebGL is not initializing properly? If so then keep on reading and I’ll explain a very quick switch that you can toggle in order to access the Body Browser and other WebGL applications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fire up Firefox 4 and type “about:config” into your address bar then press Enter on your keyboard.</li>
  <li>You may get a <strong>warning about dragons.</strong> Tell Firefox you are aware of them and that you’ll be careful by clicking the “I’ll be careful, I promise!” button.</li>
  <li>Type into the “Filter: box” below the address bar the word “webgl”. You should now see most (if not all) of the <strong>WebGL options</strong> in Firefox 4.</li>
  <li>Scan the list for “webgl.force-enabled” under “Preference Name” (or type it in the filter, whichever is fastest for you), if the “Value” is set to false then right-click it and select “Toggle”; it should change to true.</li>
  <li>Re-open the <a href="http://bodybrowser.googlelabs.com/">Google Body</a> page and it should be working</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can browse the anatomy of a human female or maybe you can view some other WebGL content. <strong>If you have problems with Firefox 4 after enabling this then you should disable it</strong>; one would assume it’s in beta (since not enabled by default) or you may have actually <strong>awoken a dragon</strong>.</p>
