<p>A new album by heavy metal band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenged_Sevenfold">Avenged Sevenfold</a> has been released on the 27th of July. The album is dedicated to their lost drummer and friend; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rev">The Rev</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater">Dream Theatre</a> drummer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Portnoy">Mike Portnoy</a> has assisted the band in completing the album in The Rev’s absence.</p>

<p>I’d like to write about a couple of songs from the album. The first being my favourite song from the album <strong>Save Me</strong>. This song progresses through a variety of different stages. The vocals, guitar and drumming are all very passionately composed together. This song is a 10 minute wonder and it’s just one of those songs I find myself uncontrollably turning on when I crank on the iPod.</p>

<p>The second song titled <strong>So Far Away</strong> may well be my second favourite song on the album. This song contains <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synyster_Gates">Synyster Gates’</a> (Lead Guitarist) first ever written lyrics. The song is relatively slow compared to the rest of the album. It starts off with only a singer and guitarist playing then finishes on a more epic note with the rest of the band joining in. The lyrics have been very passionately conceived and are straight to the point.</p>

<p>The rest of the album is also brilliant and well worth listening to. I realize that this isn’t everyone’s type of music but I think there should at least be something on the album that you find interesting.</p>
