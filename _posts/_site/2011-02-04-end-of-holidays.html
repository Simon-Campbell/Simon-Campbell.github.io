<p>I know I’m more than a month late, but I hope everyone had a very merry Christmas and a happy new year. I hope the rest of the year is filled with opportunities and good times for everyone.</p>

<p>My summer holidays are coming to an end. I’ve enjoyed the break from university but the lack of a routine is getting to me, even more so that my family and girlfriend have gotten back into their daily routines.</p>

<p>In light of this, I’ve thought to myself about what I can do for the next month of my holiday. I can’t go on doing things without a cause, that seems to me like a waste of time. I could be more productive, I could be building things and learning in anticipation of going back to university.</p>

<p>I thought that I’d create some sort of agenda for me to follow: something that will remind me to <em>get things done</em>. As of right now, I seem to just be doing a lot of non-important things such as browsing the internet or screwing around with my <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/2.371/xperiax10">XPERIA X10 Android phone</a>.</p>

<p>It would be nice to work on some sort of project to be able to stick on my resumé for when I finish university, a project that would also further my learning in C#, .NET and give me more programming experience in general. That project is a Pawn IDE, simply named “PawnEditor”.</p>

<p>I’ve also started adding some improvements to <a href="https://github.com/Simon-Campbell/las-venturas-arena">LVA</a> (a branch of LW_LVDM), I’m adding the ideas to LVA because LW_LVDM seems to be evolving into something different to what I envisioned. The first update to LVA will be a more friendly UI, those who have stumbled onto <a href="http://twitter.com/simon2k6">my Twitter page</a> will have seen developments of that a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>Another thing I’d like to do is read in hopes of improving English literacy skills as I believe mine are starting to slip. Although I have quite a bit of spare time due to holidays, it still feels difficult to whip out an “<em>old-fashione</em>d” book and start comfortably reading. I am currently attempting to read a novel named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, which I hope can be finished in good time.</p>

<p>Finally, it think it would be a good idea to post some Pawn tutorials. I believe that the best way of learning is to teach, therefore if I post up some Pawn tutorials it will also help me clarify and remember programming and Pawn concepts.</p>
