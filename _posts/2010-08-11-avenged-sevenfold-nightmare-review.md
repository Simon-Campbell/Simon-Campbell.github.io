A new album by heavy metal band [Avenged Sevenfold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenged_Sevenfold) has been released on the 27th of July. The album is dedicated to their lost drummer and friend; [The Rev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rev). [Dream Theatre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Theater) drummer [Mike Portnoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Portnoy) has assisted the band in completing the album in The Rev's absence.

I'd like to write about a couple of songs from the album. The first being my favourite song from the album **Save Me**. This song progresses through a variety of different stages. The vocals, guitar and drumming are all very passionately composed together. This song is a 10 minute wonder and it's just one of those songs I find myself uncontrollably turning on when I crank on the iPod.

The second song titled **So Far Away** may well be my second favourite song on the album. This song contains [Synyster Gates'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synyster_Gates) (Lead Guitarist) first ever written lyrics. The song is relatively slow compared to the rest of the album. It starts off with only a singer and guitarist playing then finishes on a more epic note with the rest of the band joining in. The lyrics have been very passionately conceived and are straight to the point.

The rest of the album is also brilliant and well worth listening to. I realize that this isn't everyone's type of music but I think there should at least be something on the album that you find interesting.
