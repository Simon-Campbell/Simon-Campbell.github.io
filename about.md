I am a software developer at Enlighten Designs since late 2013.

From 2010 to 2013 I studied Software Engineering at the University of Waikato (UoW). At the UoW I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree. 

During my university studies I undertook internships as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems and at Datacom.
